![Fill Time Out Error Screen](/images/error_thermistor_open.png)

This message occurs when the thermistor is not working properly. While it may be possible to restart the machine and temporarily by-pass this message, it is best to [dispatch a service technician](/brewing/dispatch_open_thermistor.md) to address the issue.
