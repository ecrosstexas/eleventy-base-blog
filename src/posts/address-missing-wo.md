![Accurants WO missing address/phone](/images/pdf-wo-missing-address.png)

This is a bug with the TeaWorld-Accurants Sync.

If you have a workorder missing the location address and/or phone you can do the following workaround to fix the issue:

Go to the [Location screen](https://teazzers.azurewebsites.net/Locations) and click update without making any changes.
In [Accurants](https://www.accurants.com/Invoice/ManageWorkOrder.aspx), reload the Work Order. After that, the address and/or phone should appear.

Please try these steps and let me know.
