We are working on a fix for this. It will be rolled out next week. In the meanwhile, you can do the following workaround to fix the issue:

Go to the [Asset screen]() for that machine and click update without making any changes.
Then go to the [Location screen]() and click update without making any changes.
In [Accurants](), reload the Work Order. After that, the Equipment should appear in the dropdown list.

Please try these steps and let me know.

Thanks,

Sameer
